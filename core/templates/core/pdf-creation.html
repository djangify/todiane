    <!-- Quick Answers -->
    <section class="mt-16">
      <h2 class="leading-normal">Quick Answers About Business PDFs</h2>
      <div class="space-y-6 mt-6">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg mt-8 font-semibold">What is the benefit of having a business PDF?</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">A professional PDF provides a lasting resource for lead generation, client education, or direct sales. Unlike social media posts, which disappear quickly, PDFs are downloaded, saved, and often shared. This permanence helps you build stronger connections with your audience and gives them a reason to return to your expertise repeatedly.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">How long should a business PDF be?</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Most effective PDFs run between 8–20 pages. This length strikes the balance between depth and readability. Too short, and it won’t feel valuable; too long, and readers may never finish it. The sweet spot is enough content to solve a problem clearly while being concise enough to consume in one sitting. Design, flow, and readability matter just as much as length.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Can I create a PDF myself?</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">Yes, you can create a PDF yourself using free or low-cost design tools. However, many business owners discover that DIY PDFs look inconsistent or take too much time. A done-for-you service saves you effort and ensures the finished document looks polished, branded, and professional. The question is whether you want to invest hours learning design, or focus on your business and outsource the task.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">What types of businesses benefit most from PDFs?</h3>
          <p class="mt-2 mb-12 text-gray-700">PDFs work especially well for experts who rely on trust and authority: coaches, consultants, therapists, trainers, and service providers. These businesses often need lead magnets, onboarding guides, or educational resources. Because PDFs are easy to download and share, they extend your reach and allow you to provide structured value to potential and current clients alike.</p>

        <details class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
          <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">Do I need design skills to make a PDF?</summary>
          <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 px-4">Not really. Many small business owners start with Canva or Word, but the final result can look inconsistent or off-brand. Professional PDF design creates alignment with your brand colours, fonts, and style. That polish builds trust and credibility with your audience, ensuring your knowledge is taken seriously. A done-for-you service guarantees a professional finish while saving you valuable time.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
          <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What formats can my PDF be used in?</summary>
          <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 px-4">PDFs are highly versatile. They can be offered as lead magnets, shared with clients as onboarding material, used as course workbooks, or sold directly as digital products. Because PDFs are universally readable on almost every device, you don’t need special software or platforms. This makes them one of the easiest and most flexible tools for small business experts who want to showcase knowledge.</p>

        <details class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
          <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How long does it take to create a business PDF?</summary>
          <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 px-4">A short, simple lead magnet may be created within a week if your text is ready, while a more complex workbook or ebook often takes three to four weeks. The biggest factor is whether you’re creating new content or repurposing existing material. Using a done-for-you service shortens the process considerably, since design, formatting, and flow are managed by a professional instead of you.</p>

          <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What’s the difference between a PDF and an ebook?</summary>
          <p class="mt-3 text-gray-700 px-4">PDFs are fixed-layout documents that preserve design, images, and branding, making them perfect for professional business use. Ebooks are usually reflowable text files formatted for Kindle or e-readers. While ebooks suit long-form reading, PDFs are better for guides, checklists, and workbooks. For most small businesses, PDFs are more practical because they are easy to distribute, can be branded, and are cost-effective to produce.</p>
