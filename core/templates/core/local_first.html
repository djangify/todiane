      Local-First & Self-Hosted Development
    </h1>
    <p>
      I build Django applications, self-hosted tools, and offline-friendly systems with a growing focus on 
      local-first development. This page brings together the articles, explanations, and resources behind 
      my approach. If you value digital independence, privacy, and control over your software, you’ll find 
      this direction meaningful.

        What Does Local-First Mean?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Local-first software is designed so that your data lives on your device first, not on a remote server. 
        Cloud sync becomes optional rather than mandatory. This approach gives people more control, privacy, 
        and long-term stability. Local-first doesn’t reject modern cloud development — it simply places the 
        user at the centre, ensuring the software continues to work even if the internet is unavailable or a 
        service shuts down.

      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-3 text-[color:var(--color-brand-secondary)]">Why This Matters</h3>
      <p>
        More tools are becoming subscription-only, platform-dependent, and locked behind accounts. For creators 
        and small businesses, this creates unnecessary risk. Local-first and self-hosted systems offer an 
        alternative that prioritises stability, affordability, and ownership — values that are becoming 
        increasingly important in today’s digital landscape.

          Does local-first mean avoiding the cloud entirely?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Not at all. Local-first does not reject the cloud — it reframes the relationship between the user 
          and the system. Your data lives on your device first, ensuring the tool works offline and remains 
          functional regardless of external services. Cloud storage can still be used for syncing or backups, 
          but it becomes optional rather than required. This gives users more freedom, better privacy, and 
          resilience, without losing the convenience of cloud-based features when they choose to use them.

      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-[color:var(--color-brand-secondary)]">
          How is local-first different from self-hosted software?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Local-first focuses on storing and processing data directly on your personal device, while 
          self-hosted software is typically run on your own server or hosting environment. The two overlap, 
          but they aren’t identical. You can have a self-hosted tool that still relies heavily on cloud 
          services, and you can have a local-first tool that never touches a server. My work blends both 
          approaches to prioritise privacy, ownership, and long-term stability for the user.

      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-[color:var(--color-brand-secondary)]">
          Why are local-first and self-hosted systems important for creators?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Creators rely on consistency and control. When a platform changes pricing, removes features, or 
          shuts down, the consequences are immediate. Local-first and self-hosted systems reduce this risk 
          by giving creators more independence. Their work, data, and tools remain accessible and stable, 
          even as the digital landscape evolves. This approach also lowers ongoing costs, making it easier 
          to run a sustainable creative business without relying on multiple monthly subscriptions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-[color:var(--color-brand-secondary)]">
          Can local-first tools still work across multiple devices?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yes — local-first doesn’t eliminate multi-device access. It simply means that syncing happens on 
          your terms. Instead of a platform controlling where your data goes or how it syncs, you can choose 
          peer-to-peer syncing, your own storage provider, or a simple encrypted cloud folder. This gives you 
          flexibility without forcing you into a specific ecosystem. The key idea is that your data is always 
          controlled by you, not locked into a third-party service.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-[color:var(--color-brand-secondary)]">
          Are local-first tools harder to maintain or update?
        </h3>
        <p>
          They can be if they’re designed poorly, but modern development patterns make maintenance very 
          manageable. Local-first tools benefit from simpler dependencies, fewer external integrations, 
          and far less fragility compared to cloud-heavy SaaS. Because the core functionality runs locally, 
          updates can be shipped efficiently without risking downtime or breaking critical workflows. In 
          many cases, local-first systems are more stable because they rely on fewer moving parts.

      <div>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-[color:var(--color-brand-secondary)]">
          Is local-first suitable for all types of software?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Local-first is powerful, but not universally applicable. Tools requiring large-scale real-time 
          collaboration or heavy cloud computation may still benefit from cloud-first designs. However, many 
          everyday tools — journaling systems, productivity apps, financial organisers, small business tools, 
          writing apps, and personal dashboards — are perfect candidates for local-first development. Most 
          people simply don’t need a cloud-dependent system for personal work, and benefit from keeping their 
          data close to home.
